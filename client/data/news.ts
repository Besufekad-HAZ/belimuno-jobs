      <h2>Congratulations to Our Dedicated Team</h2>
      <p>
        The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) has successfully completed the renovation of the historic Africa Hall in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, marking a significant milestone in preserving African heritage and promoting unity. This project, which cost approximately $57 million, aimed to modernize the facility while honoring its rich history as the birthplace of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1963.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Africa Hall has long been a symbol of African history and culture, hosting numerous pivotal events in the continent's quest for unity and independence. The renovation included structural upgrades to enhance safety and accessibility, as well as the addition of modern conference facilities that meet international standards. A permanent exhibition will also be established to showcase the hall's architectural significance and its role in pan-Africanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations to our dedicated team at Belimuno HR Outsourcing Solution for their contributions to this monumental project. Their expertise in human resource management has played a crucial role in ensuring that the renovation was executed smoothly, employing both local and international talent. This achievement not only reflects Belimuno's commitment to excellence but also highlights our ongoing support for initiatives that celebrate and preserve Ethiopia's cultural heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The official inauguration of the renovated Africa Hall took place on October 21, 2024, where dignitaries gathered to celebrate this landmark achievement. As we reflected on this event, we were proud to have been part of a project that reinforced the importance of historical preservation and cultural identity in Africa.
